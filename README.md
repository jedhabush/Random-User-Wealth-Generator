# Random-User-Wealth-Generator

It is a simple program using fetch API, it generates randome users and random wealth and it has few options such as add more random users, sort users by richest, double their money (wealth),
Show users that only have a million and above and calculate the total wealth.

The whole point of this mini program is to use few array methods such as forEach() , map(), filter() and reduce()

The design/ style was not a priority in this project.
